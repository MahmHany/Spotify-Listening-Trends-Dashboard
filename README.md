<h2>Project Overview</h2>
The Spotify Listening Trends Dashboard is an interactive data visualization and analytics project designed to provide deep insights into Spotify user listening behavior, content performance, and engagement patterns. Built using a business intelligence tool (likely Power BI, based on the interface), this project analyzes key metrics such as album and track play counts, artist popularity, listening hours, and track frequency. The dashboard is divided into three main sections—Overview, Listening Patterns, and Track Details—each offering a unique perspective on Spotify data to support content strategy, user engagement analysis, and platform optimization for stakeholders.

## Key Features

- **Overview Page: Content Performance Metrics**  
The Overview page offers a snapshot of key performance indicators, displaying metrics like total albums played (7383), total artists played (3835), and total tracks played (12,724), alongside yearly trends (e.g., 5.26% decrease in albums played from the previous year), for a quick understanding of Spotify content engagement.

- **Overview Page: Top Performers Analysis**  
This page highlights top-performing content with bar charts, showcasing the top 5 albums (e.g., *The Wall* with 1827 plays), top 5 artists (e.g., The Beatles with 5.1K plays), and top 5 tracks (e.g., *Comfortably Numb* with 180 plays), providing insights into user preferences and popular content.

- **Listening Patterns Page: Temporal Listening Trends**  
The Listening Patterns page visualizes user activity with a heatmap of listening hours by day and hour, identifying peak times like Saturdays at midnight (4015 hours), and a scatter plot comparing average listening time to track frequency, revealing behavioral trends such as shorter listening times for frequently played tracks.

- **Track Details Page: Granular Track Insights**  
This page presents a detailed table of individual tracks, including metrics like album name, number of tracks, milliseconds, and average listening time (e.g., *Awaken, My Love!* with 1.47 hours average listening time), with totals showing 19,665 tracks and an average listening time of 2.14 hours across the dataset.

- **Interactive Filtering: Platform and Behavior Analysis**  
The dashboard includes filters for platform (Android, iOS, macOS, web player, Windows), shuffle status, and skipped status, allowing users to analyze listening trends across different devices and user behaviors, enhancing the depth of insights.

<h2>Tech Stack </h2>

<h2>Why This Project? </h2>

This project was developed to assist Spotify’s content and user engagement teams in understanding listening trends, optimizing content recommendations, and improving user experience. By identifying popular albums, artists, and tracks, as well as peak listening times, the dashboard enables data-driven decisions to enhance content curation and platform engagement. It also provides insights into user behavior, helping to tailor marketing strategies and improve retention.
